bbrun script is a specialised scripting language for testing Rest APIs and gRPC services.

It is a domain specific language (DSL) that is easy to learn and use.

A simple example would be to get a url, and test that the response is as expected.

The project should maintain 
    - the specification of the language in a form of documentation
    - the Java library that interprets and run the script
    - the gradle plugin that runs scripts with a dedicated gradle task.
    - the maven project that runs scripts with a dedicated maven plugin.
